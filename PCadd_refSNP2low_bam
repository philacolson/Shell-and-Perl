PC_add_refSNP2low_bam

Grab the High_bam_file.out and the Bam_low.out

Grep all the "rs" entries from Bam_low.out and put them in rs.lst

if there is anything in rs.lst, exit out, as it has already been annotated

remove anything called rs_high.sort

Grep all the "rs" entries from High_bam_file.out, grep the SNPs from that, grab the first and last columns, sort them, and put the end result in rs_high.sort

if it's empty, that's bad.  Exit.

sort the Bam_low.out and put it in low.sort

Join low.sort and rs_high.sort and print every line to Bam_low.out.temp

cut the first column out of that and put it in low_match.lst

using all the entries from Bam_low.out.temp, see if the match anywhere with low_match.lst.  If they do, throw them away.  If not, keep them and put them in low_left.out

Combine low_left.out with Bam_low.out.temp and call it the original file, Bam_low.out
